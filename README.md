# Project 7: Personal Website

Project: Project 7 is the final project for CIT 281, where we create a personal website hosted on GitHub. This website serves as a portfolio to showcase our work and skills. The project involves creating a GitHub repository, adding content to it, and pushing changes to GitHub using Visual Studio Code. The website is built using HTML, CSS, with a possible future integration of JavaScript, and it includes various sections. The idea is to have this website grow overtime and showcase more of my work as I progress through the CIT minor.

Lab 8: In Lab 8, we futhered our practice with server-side JavaScript by creating a simple Node.js application. The ultimate goal of this server was to accept GET requests that woulde return a JSON object containing information about an image. This project was also the first project where we connected our routes to an external sites, in this case JSONPlaceholder.

Lab 9: In Lab 9, we worked with GitHub to learn about release based workflows. We followed the GitHub "Create a relesasebased workflow" activity. During this activity, we learned how to go through version releases, and how to best use release version naming to indicate what kind of release it is. We did this using the GitHub release feature, which made it easy to create a new release.

# Project 6: Client-Server Based Project

Project: Project 6 allowed us to be creative and create a program of our choice. The goal was to use AI to help link the server to a client, allowing the program to be run in a browser in a web browser. My project was a simple to-do list. The user has the ability to add, modify, and delete items on the to-do list which is displayed on the webpage. The list updates dynamically based on the operation they perform. I tested this first in the console and then connected it to a webpage and stylesheet. AI was used to create the HTML and CSS files. AI was used minimally for the server to help decide what the different route names should be.

Lab 7: In Lab 7, our primary goal is to create a GitHub personal website within a repository.Content is added to this repository and changes are pushed to GitHub - this was done in VS Code. Within this repository, a JavaScript file named `lab-07.js` is created, and the folder is initialized using npm. The lab also involves practicing error handling by updating `lab-07.js` to include custom error handling. This lab emphasizes the use of GitHub for version control, the creation of a personal website, and the practice of error handling in JavaScript.

# Project 5: Game Creation

Project: Project 5 allowed us to be creative and create a program of our choice. We were encouraged to use AI to build the client (HTML and CSS files). I decicded to creat a game called "LootBox Roulette". In this game, each player starts with 100 coins. They are then able to buy an item from a lootbox. The items come in common, rare, and legendary. The player clicks the button called ‘Open Box’. This will give them one item from either a common, rare, or legendary box. This is then displayed on the screen. Once the player reaches less than 10 coins, they will no longer be able to purchase any more boxes. The player inputs their name using the /:name part of the route. This tracks each player’s inventory for each server session. Once the server is ended and restarted, each player’s inventory is wiped. You could theoretically make as many players as your memory allowed per session. Copilot helped me walk through linking up files together, and where it made sense to put different code blocks. ChatGPT came up with the idea for the game and built the html file and CSS files. It also helped with the conceptual aspect of game play.

Lab 6: In Lab 6, we practiced getting more familiar with GitHub. We completed the Introduction to GitHub course on GitHub Learning Lab. We then moved over to VS Code and completed a task involving creating a classfor a libary inventory. We practiced adding new classes by running our functions.

# Project 4: Intro to Postman

Project: Project 4 focused on server communication using Postman. We built off of our previous project where we learned how to export and import functions. This time, we focused on making requests to our server using Postman. We also learned how to handle different types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. We learned how to handle unknown routes and how to return appropriate responses. Throughout this project, we implemented testing functions to ensure that we were on track for a successful project.

Lab 5: In Lab 5, we set up Postman on our computers. We also learned how to navigate the interface to switch between different requests. We practiced making GET and POST requests to our server. We dealt with a database of students and depending on the route, we returned unique information for that specific student.

# Project 3: Server Communication and JSON

Project: Project 3 focused on server communication and JSON. This was our first project where we built a server using Node.js. Our server imported functions to be run when a request was made to a specific route. This built off of our previous project where we learned how to export and import functions. Finally, we added an HTML page that interacted with our server.

Lab 3: In Lab 3, we focused on refactoring JS code into a more modern form. We also practiced object destructuring and console JSON output. This was also the first lab where we practiced exporting functions to be used in another file. This lab really focused on manipulating data.

Lab 4: In Lab 4, we practice initlializing a Node.js server. We did this by using the inline command 'npm init'. We also practiced installing express to help us build our server. This lab also touched on dealing with error, specifically a MIME error. We were seeing issues with a linked HTML file being returned to the browser as text, and not HTML. We also added routes with query parameters.

# Project 2: GIT and GitHub Interaction

Project: Project 2 focused on JS and git commiting. We went through multiple iterations of file and would commit at different stages. We utilized the '-m' feature to help keep track of what we changed. This was also the first time where we experiemented with staging files before committing them. To do this, we used the Source Control tab in VS Code. This allowed us to see what files were staged, and which ones were not in a simple and easy to read format.

Lab 2: Lab 2 built off of Lab 1. We initialized git using 'git init', and then new file to this git Repository. Next, we went through the process of adding and comitting files. Along with this, we practiced using '.gitignore' to ignore files that we did not want to commit. Additionally, we learned how clone cloud repos locally. We also practiced branching these repos to test new features.

# Project 1: Command Line Interface (CLI)

Project: Project 1 kickstarted our CIT 281 journey. This project focused on building understanding of the command line interface (CLI) and its functionalities. We learned how to navigate the CLI, execute commands, and manage files and directories. We started by experimenting with commands to make a tree file structure. Then, we experimented with the ping functionality to test network connectivity. Finally, we were required to create JS file that would output the day of the week for the current date. We used this requirement to practice with the built-in debug functionality in VS Code.

Lab 1: Lab 1 focused on setting up our coding environment on our personal computers. We installed some useful extensions in VS Code, as well as used the integrated terminal to install git. We also used this lab to practice using basic inline commands such as 'mkdir', 'cd', and 'ls' to navigate the file system.
